# Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Been Built

### 1. âœ… Content Watcher Activity Panel
A real-time, collapsible panel showing watcher activity with SSE streaming.

**Features:**
- FAB-style button in bottom-right corner
- Real-time event streaming via Server-Sent Events
- Persistent log (last 100 events)
- Shows major processing stages:
  - File detection (with file size)
  - AI metadata generation (with title)
  - Video analysis (duration, aspect ratio)
  - Audio matching (track name)
  - Video processing (type)
  - Platform uploads (start + complete)
  - Errors (with stage context)
- Search/filter events
- Auto-scroll with manual override
- Connection status indicators
- Clear history button

**Files Created:**
- `src/content_creation/watcher_events.py` - Event emitter system

- `src/analytics/api_server.py` - Added SSE endpoints
- `analytics-dashboard/src/App.tsx` - Integrated panel

### 2. âœ… OBS Studio Auto-Detection
Automatically detects OBS and configures the watch directory!

**Features:**
- Detects if OBS is running
- Finds OBS installation and config
- Reads active profile
- Extracts replay buffer path
- Auto-configures watch directory
- Shows OBS status in startup logs
- Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Handles BOM in OBS config files
- Smart path validation

**Files Created:**
- `src/content_creation/obs_detector.py` - OBS detection module
- `scripts/test_obs_detection.py` - Test script
- `OBS_DETECTION_GUIDE.md` - User guide
- `OBS_DETECTION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical summary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/content_creation/clip_watcher.py` - Integrated OBS detection
- `src/analytics/api_server.py` - Added OBS status endpoint
- `pyproject.toml` - Added psutil dependency

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/obs/status` - Get OBS detection info

**Test Results:**
```
ðŸŽ¬ OBS Studio Detection

## How to Use Everything

### Starting the System

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. **Test OBS Detection (Optional):**
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/test_obs_detection.py
   ```

3. **Start the API Server:**
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/analytics/start_analytics.py
   ```

4. **Start the Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   cd analytics-dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Start the Content Watcher:**
   ```bash
   uv run python main.py
   ```

### Using the Features

#### Watcher Panel
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5174/dashboard`
2. Look for the eye icon in the bottom-right corner
3. Click to expand and see activity
4. Drop a video in your watch directory
5. Watch real-time events flow through the panel!

#### OBS Auto-Detection
1. Configure replay buffer in OBS (Settings â†’ Output)
2. Start the watcher - it automatically finds the path
3. Hit your OBS replay buffer hotkey
4. Watch the watcher process it automatically!
