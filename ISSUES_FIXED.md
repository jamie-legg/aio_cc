# Issues Fixed - October 20, 2025

## Issue 1: Videos Uploading Immediately Instead of Scheduling âœ… FIXED

### Problem
When recording a clip, it was immediately uploaded to all platforms instead of being added to the schedule.

### Root Cause
The clip watcher was not checking the `auto_schedule` configuration setting and was always calling the immediate upload function.

### Fix Applied
- Updated `src/content_creation/clip_watcher.py` to check `config.auto_schedule`
- Added environment variable support for `AUTO_SCHEDULE`
- Added clear visual feedback when videos are scheduled
- Updated `env.example` with scheduling configuration options

### How to Use
The default behavior is now to **schedule videos** instead of uploading immediately.

#### To Keep Scheduling (Default - Recommended)
Your videos will be automatically scheduled. You'll see:
```
[âœ“ SCHEDULED] Video added to schedule!
   ðŸ“… Time: 08:00 PM on October 20, 2025
   ðŸ“± Platforms: INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE, TIKTOK
   ðŸ“Š View schedule: http://localhost:5173/uploads
```

#### To Disable Scheduling (Go Back to Immediate Upload)
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
AUTO_SCHEDULE=false
```

Then restart services:
```bash
uv run python scripts/start_all.py
```

### Testing the Fix
1. Make sure `AUTO_SCHEDULE=true` in your `.env` (or just leave it unset, true is default)
2. Restart all services: `uv run python scripts/start_all.py`
3. Record a new clip with OBS
4. You should see the scheduling messages instead of immediate upload
5. Check the schedule at http://localhost:5173/uploads

## Issue 2: Weird Output Format / Services Stopping

### Observed Behavior
The output showed services stopping (`[INFO] Stopping all services...`) but then the watcher continued running, creating mixed output.

### Likely Cause
This typically happens when:
1. Services are interrupted (Ctrl+C) and then restarted
2. One service crashes and the script stops all services, then they're manually restarted
3. Multiple terminal windows are running services

### How the Start Script Works
The `scripts/start_all.py` script:
- Starts all services (WATCHER, API, SCHEDULER, DASHBOARD)
- Monitors them continuously
- If ANY service crashes, stops ALL services
- Prefixes each line with colored tags: `[WATCHER]`, `[API]`, etc.

### Recommendations
1. **Use only one terminal** - Run all services from a single terminal using:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/start_all.py
   ```

2. **Don't run services separately** - Avoid running `main.py` or other scripts directly while `start_all.py` is running

3. **Clean restart** - If output looks weird:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services
   - Wait for "All services stopped" message
   - Run `uv run python scripts/start_all.py` again

4. **Check for multiple instances** - Make sure you don't have services running in other terminals:
   ```powershell
   # On Windows PowerShell
   Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*start_all*"}
   ```

### Normal Output Should Look Like
```
[WATCHER] [+] Detected new clip: Replay 2025-10-20 19-47-40.mp4
[WATCHER] [ANALYSIS] Video analysis:
[WATCHER]    Duration: 28.0s (max: 180s)
[API] INFO:     127.0.0.1:51634 - "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
[SCHEDULER] Checking for due posts...
[DASHBOARD] 7:52:29 PM [vite] hmr update /src/App.tsx
```

All services running together with clear prefixes.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the scheduling feature**:
   - Record a new clip
   - Verify it appears in the schedule
   - Check that it posts automatically at the scheduled time

2. **Review scheduled posts**:
   - Visit http://localhost:5173/uploads
   - See all scheduled videos
   - Edit or cancel if needed

3. **Configure to your preference**:
   - Adjust `SCHEDULE_SPACING_HOURS` if you want more/less spacing
   - Adjust `DEFAULT_POST_TIME_OFFSET` to change when first post happens
   - Set `AUTO_SCHEDULE=false` if you prefer immediate uploads
