# All Fixes Summary - October 20, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… 1. Videos Uploading Immediately Instead of Scheduling
**Problem**: Recorded clips were immediately uploaded to all platforms instead of being added to the schedule.

**Fix**: Updated `src/content_creation/clip_watcher.py` to check the `AUTO_SCHEDULE` config setting (default: `true`).

**Files Modified**:
- `src/content_creation/clip_watcher.py`
- `src/managers/config_manager.py`
- `env.example`

---

### âœ… 2. Dashboard Logs Not Showing
**Problem**: Vite/dashboard logs were not appearing in the unified output.

**Fix**: Rewrote the `stream_output()` function to use queue-based threading that reads from both stdout and stderr simultaneously.

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/start_all.py`

---

### âœ… 3. Ctrl+C Not Stopping Services
**Problem**: Pressing Ctrl+C didn't properly stop all services, especially on Windows.

**Fix**: Added proper signal handling and Windows-compatible process tree killing using `taskkill`.

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/start_all.py`

---

### âœ… 4. Scheduler Daemon Database Method Error
**Problem**: Scheduler daemon was calling `update_scheduled_post()` which doesn't exist.

**Error Message**:
```
'AnalyticsDatabase' object has no attribute 'update_scheduled_post'
```

**Fix**: Changed all calls from `update_scheduled_post()` to `update_post_status()` (the correct method name).

**Files Modified**:
- `src/scheduling/scheduler_daemon.py`

---

### âœ… 5. Scheduler Upload Manager Method Calls
**Problem**: Scheduler was calling upload manager methods with wrong arguments (individual parameters instead of metadata dict).

**Fix**: Updated scheduler to pass metadata as a dictionary to match the upload manager interface.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/scheduling/scheduler_daemon.py`

---

## Summary of Changes

### `src/content_creation/clip_watcher.py`
```python
# Now checks auto_schedule config
current_config = config_manager.get_config()
if current_config.auto_schedule:
    schedule_for_posting(upload_path, ai_meta)
else:
    upload_to_social_media(upload_path, ai_meta)
```

### `src/managers/config_manager.py`
```python
# Added environment variable support
auto_schedule: bool = os.getenv("AUTO_SCHEDULE", "true").lower() in ("true", "1", "yes", "on")
schedule_spacing_hours: int = 1
default_post_time_offset: int = 1
```

### `scripts/start_all.py`
- Queue-based output streaming (reads stdout and stderr simultaneously)
- Proper signal handling for Ctrl+C
- Windows-compatible process tree killing
- Graceful shutdown with 2-second timeout before force kill

### `src/scheduling/scheduler_daemon.py`
- Fixed database method calls: `update_scheduled_post()` â†’ `update_post_status()`
- Fixed upload manager calls to pass metadata as dictionary
- Added video file existence check
- Better error handling and logging

---

## How to Use

### 1. Auto-Scheduling (Default)
Videos are automatically scheduled 1 hour after processing with 1-hour spacing between posts.

**To enable** (default):
```bash
# In .env file
AUTO_SCHEDULE=true
```

**To disable** (immediate upload):
```bash
# In .env file
AUTO_SCHEDULE=false
```

### 2. Starting Services
```bash
# Start all services with unified output
uv run python scripts/start_all.py
```

You should now see:
- âœ… **[WATCHER]** - Clip detection and processing
- âœ… **[API]** - HTTP request logs
- âœ… **[SCHEDULER]** - Scheduled post processing
- âœ… **[DASHBOARD]** - Vite dev server output

### 3. Stopping Services
Press **Ctrl+C** once. The script will:
1. Show "Shutdown signal received..."
2. Try graceful termination (2 seconds)
3. Force kill if needed (Windows: `taskkill /F /T`)
4. Show "All services stopped" when complete

### 4. Viewing Scheduled Posts
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5173/uploads
- Click "Scheduled" tab
- See all pending posts with times
- Edit or delete as needed

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Scheduling
1. Restart services: `uv run python scripts/start_all.py`
2. Record a new clip with OBS
3. You should see:
   ```
   [WATCHER] ============================================================
   [WATCHER] [SCHEDULING] Preparing to schedule video for later posting...
   [WATCHER] ============================================================
   [WATCHER] [SCHEDULING] Platforms: INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE, TIKTOK
   [WATCHER]
   [WATCHER] [âœ“ SCHEDULED] Video added to schedule!
   [WATCHER]    ðŸ“… Time: 08:00 PM on October 20, 2025
   [WATCHER]    ðŸ“± Platforms: INSTAGRAM, YOUTUBE, TIKTOK
   [WATCHER]    ðŸ“Š View schedule: http://localhost:5173/uploads
   ```
4. Check http://localhost:5173/uploads - video should be in "Scheduled" tab

### Test 2: Dashboard Logs
You should see vite output like:
```
[DASHBOARD]   VITE v4.5.14  ready in 999 ms
[DASHBOARD]   âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
[DASHBOARD]   âžœ  Network: http://192.168.1.83:5173/
[DASHBOARD] 7:52:29 PM [vite] hmr update /src/App.tsx
```

### Test 3: Ctrl+C Shutdown
1. Press Ctrl+C once
2. Wait for "All services stopped" message
3. Terminal should exit cleanly

### Test 4: Scheduler Posting
The scheduler runs every 60 seconds and processes due posts. When a scheduled time arrives:
```
[SCHEDULER] 2025-10-20 20:25:16,754 - __main__ - INFO - Found 1 due posts to process
[SCHEDULER] 2025-10-20 20:25:16,754 - __main__ - INFO - Posting video to instagram, youtube, tiktok
[SCHEDULER] âœ… Uploaded to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/...
[SCHEDULER] âœ… Uploaded to Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reel/...
[SCHEDULER] âœ… Uploaded to TikTok: Video published to TikTok
[SCHEDULER] âœ… Successfully posted video
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: 22 due posts found
This means you have 22 old scheduled posts that are past their scheduled time. The scheduler will try to process them all.

**To clear old posts**:
```bash
# Option 1: Cancel them via dashboard
# Go to http://localhost:5173/uploads, click "Delete" on old posts

# Option 2: Mark as failed in database
# (Ask for help with this if needed)
```

### Issue: Services won't stop
If Ctrl+C doesn't work:
1. Close the terminal window
2. Run this PowerShell command:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*start_all*"} | Stop-Process -Force
   ```
3. Or manually kill processes in Task Manager

### Issue: "Video file not found"
The video path in the database may be incorrect. Check:
- Video still exists in the Processed folder
- Path uses correct Windows path format
- File wasn't moved or deleted

## Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
```bash
# Scheduling
AUTO_SCHEDULE=true                    # true = schedule, false = immediate upload
SCHEDULE_SPACING_HOURS=1              # Hours between posts
DEFAULT_POST_TIME_OFFSET=1            # Hours after processing to schedule

# Upload Platforms
UPLOAD_TO_INSTAGRAM=true
UPLOAD_TO_YOUTUBE=true
UPLOAD_TO_TIKTOK=true
```

### Config File (`~/.content_creation/config.json`)
```json
{
  "auto_schedule": true,
  "schedule_spacing_hours": 1,
  "default_post_time_offset": 1,
  "upload_to_instagram": true,
  "upload_to_youtube": true,
  "upload_to_tiktok": true
}
```

## What's Next

1. **Test the scheduling feature** with a new clip
2. **Clear old scheduled posts** if you have many pending
3. **Adjust timing** if you want different spacing between posts
4. **Monitor the scheduler** logs to ensure posts go out successfully

All fixes are complete and ready to test!
